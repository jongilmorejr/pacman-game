# Contributing to Pacman-Style Game

Thanks for your interest in contributing to our family Pacman game project! ðŸŽ®

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git installed on your computer

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jongilmorejr/pacman-game.git
   cd pacman-game
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv game_env
   # On Windows:
   game_env\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source game_env/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Test the game:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Development Workflow

We use a simple Git workflow that's perfect for learning:

### 1. Create a Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# Example: git checkout -b feature/add-high-scores
```

### 2. Make Your Changes
- Edit the code
- Test your changes by running `python main.py`
- Make sure the game still works

### 3. Commit Your Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add a clear description of what you changed"
# Example: git commit -m "Add high score tracking and display"
```

### 4. Push Your Branch
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 5. Create a Pull Request
- Go to GitHub
- Click "Compare & pull request"
- Describe what you changed and why
- Request review from a family member

## Code Style Guidelines

- Use clear, descriptive variable names
- Add comments to explain complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Test your changes before submitting

   ```bash
   python -m py_compile *.py
   ```

3. **Make sure all imports work:**
